### About the project

The main purpose of this app is to give you information about the latest launch of the SpaceX rockets. You can view the details of the launch and watch the whole video.

In this project, I consumed the SpaceX Launches API. You can consume this api on your project too.
Use this endpoint to see all the launches: https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches
